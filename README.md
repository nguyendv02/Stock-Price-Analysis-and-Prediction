This project aims to predict both the stock price and the quantity of stocks purchased at a specified time interval from the current moment. Here's a concise description of its input and output:

- Input: Time duration (dd/hh/mm) from the current time.
- Output: Predicted stock price and quantity of stocks purchased at that future time.

Training data for the model includes recorded stock prices, quantities of stocks purchased, and their corresponding timestamps.
