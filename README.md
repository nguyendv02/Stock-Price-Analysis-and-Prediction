# Stock Price Analysis and Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict both the stock price and the quantity of stocks purchased at a specified time interval from the current moment. Here's a concise description of its input and output:

- Input: Time duration (dd/hh/mm) from the current time.
- Output: Predicted stock price and quantity of stocks purchased at that future time.

Training data for the model includes recorded stock prices, quantities of stocks purchased, and their corresponding timestamps.

## EDA

Visualize to examine the data distribution.

Calculate the correlation matrix and eliminate attributes with high correlation.

After plotting the value distributions and Pearson correlations, we observe the following three points:
- The features 'Low', 'High', 'Open', and 'Close' have very high correlation among them.
- The feature 'Open Interest' has a constant value of 0 for all records.
- The ticker for all records is 'FPT'.
Therefore, we should remove the following features: 'Ticker', 'Low', 'High', 'Open', and 'Open Interest' as they do not provide significant value for the target variable.

## Modeling

Data Preprocessing: Normalize 3 attributes: 'Close', 'Volume', and scale, and normalize 'time_scaled' sequence data to fit time series models (in this case, sequence length is 400).

Model Construction and Training: Build and train a deep learning LSTM model with a fixed learning rate (lr) and a learning rate schedule.

## Result

This section presents the results of the model on a test set consisting of 500 data points. The two figures below compare the model's predicted values with actual data:

- The top figure represents stock prices.
- The bottom figure represents the volume of stocks purchased.
